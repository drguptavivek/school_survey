## HOME APP Check You can see the current and candidate HOME activities with cmd package:
# CUrrent Default (what will launch on HOME):
adb shell cmd package resolve-activity --brief -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.HOME

# All apps that declare a HOME/LAUNCHER intent:
adb shell cmd package query-activities --brief -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.HOME

# Preferred/default setting (if you want the “why”):
# adb shell dumpsys package preferred-activities | grep -i home -A2



# Likely causes: app crashed or lost default-launcher role, device stuck in kiosk/lock task, or Activity not starting. Here’s a quick triage list you can run in the emulator:

 # - Verify the app is still default launcher:
    adb shell cmd package resolve-activity --brief android.intent.action.MAIN | head -1
 #   You should see your launcher’s component. If not, set it:
    adb shell cmd package set-home-activity edu.aiims.surveylauncher/.MainActivity
 # - Check if Lock Task is blocking other activities:
    adb shell dumpsys activity activities | grep mLockTaskModeState
 #   If stuck, exit: adb shell am stop-lock-task (debug only).
 # - Look for crashes on launch:
    adb logcat -d | grep -iE "FATAL|ANR|Exception|Crash"
 #   If you see your package crashing, share the stack trace.
 # - Manually start the activity and surface errors:
    adb shell am start -n edu.aiims.surveylauncher/.MainActivity
 #   Watch logcat right after: adb logcat -c && adb logcat | grep -i "surveylauncher".
 # - Confirm the APK is present and not split/uninstalled:
    adb shell pm list packages | grep surveylauncher
 #   If missing, rebuild/install: cd android-launcher && ./gradlew :app:installDebug.
 # - If you recently enabled device owner/kiosk, ensure ODK or other allowed apps are whitelisted before lock task, otherwise the screen may appear blank when the launcher blocks intent. Check policy:
    adb shell dpm get-device-owner
    adb shell dumpsys device_policy | grep -A2 lock-task


# The dpm set-lock-task-packages CLI was removed; use the device_policy service instead (requires your app to be device owner).

#  - Confirm device owner: 
adb shell dpm list-owners 
# (should show edu.aiims.surveylauncher/.admin.LauncherAdminReceiver). If not set, you’ll need to factory reset then set it.

#Set your launcher as home again: 
adb shell cmd package set-home-activity edu.aiims.surveylauncher/.MainActivity

#Disable the stock launcher so it stops winning home:
#      - Pixel: 
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher
#AOSP: 
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.android.launcher3

# Set lock task allowlist (Android 13/14+ syntax):
  adb shell cmd device_policy set-lock-task-packages --user 0 edu.aiims.surveylauncher/.admin.LauncherAdminReceiver edu.aiims.surveylauncher
# - Verify: 
adb shell cmd device_policy get-lock-task-features --user 0 edu.aiims.surveylauncher/.admin.LauncherAdminReceiver and adb shell dumpsys device_policy | grep -A2 "Lock task".
 # - If the screen stays blank, start the launcher and watch logs:
    adb shell am start -n edu.aiims.surveylauncher/.MainActivity
    adb logcat -c && adb logcat | grep -i "surveylauncher" (Ctrl+C after a few seconds).
