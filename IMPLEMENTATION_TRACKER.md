## Notes & Issues

### Technical Decisions Made:
- Using PostgreSQL 18-alpine
- Docker secrets for credential management
- Bind mounts for development hot reload
- Zod for validation (client + server)
- Drizzle ORM for database access

### Business Rules Confirmed:
1. **Unique Survey ID**: `{district_code}-{school_code}-{class}-{section}-{roll_no}`
2. **Edit Time Windows**:
   - Team members: 24 hours after submission
   - Partner managers: 15 days after submission
   - National level: No time limit
3. **District-Partner**: 1:1 relationship (one partner per district)
4. **School Deactivation**: Cannot delete schools with survey data, only deactivate
5. **Barriers**: Up to 2 selections allowed per survey
6. **Section F**: Conditional fields (only shown if uses glasses)
7. **Offline Retention**: 4 days on device
8. **Team Visibility**: Team members can see all surveys from their partner

### School Types:
- Government
- Private
- Aided
- Other

### Blockers:
- None currently

### Questions:
- All clarified
